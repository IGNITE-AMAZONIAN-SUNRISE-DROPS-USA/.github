<p><strong>Ignite Ingredients</strong></p>
<p>The main ingredients used in the Ignite formula are clearly listed on the official website. The supplement is formulated using 12 active ingredients that are collected from the Amazon rainforests and are scientifically proven to deliver a range of health benefits. The core ingredients used in Ignite are listed below along with their main benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Maca Root-</strong>&nbsp;Maca or Peruvian Ginseng, scientifically termed Lepidium meyenii, is a herbaceous biennial plant native to South America. Studies suggest that the roots of maca significantly enhance the BAM15 hormone levels in the body, reduce anxiety and depression, and also help alleviate the symptoms of menopause. Maca roots are also beneficial for improving mood and energy.</p>
<p><strong>Guarana Seed-</strong>&nbsp;Paullinia cupana, commonly known as guarana, is a climbing plant that grows in the Amazon basin and is found mostly in Brazil. Guarana seeds are proven to deliver various health benefits like stimulating the morning hormone known as BAM15 by up to 37% and preventing cardiovascular disorders.

<p><strong>Astragalus Root-</strong>&nbsp;Mongolian milkvetch, scientifically known as Astragalus propinquus, is a flowering plant that has been used in Chinese traditional medicine.

<p><strong>Grapefruit Seed-</strong>&nbsp;Citrus paradisi or grapefruit is a subtropical citrus tree that is proven to have a range of health benefits.

<p><strong>How Does Ignite Work?</strong></p>
<p>Now, let us look at the working of the&nbsp;<a href="https://sales24hour.com/7whc ">Ignite Amazonian sunrise formula.</a>&nbsp;According to the official website, Ignite is an all-natural solution that fixes the recently discovered root cause of belly fat and poor health, dormant BAM15 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before getting into the working of the supplement, let me give you some context about the hormone BAM15. BAM 15 is a morning hormone that increases insulin sensitivity and supports weight loss by melting stubborn fat in the body. This hormone also doesn&rsquo;t affect lean mass and food intake. So, it plays a major role in managing body weight and overall health. Once you start aging, BAM15 slowly becomes dormant reading to weight gain and other diseases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://sales24hour.com/7whc ">Ignite Amazonian sunrise formula</a>&nbsp;works by targeting the dormant BAM15 levels in the body. The supplement enhances the production of BAM15 thereby stimulating fat breakdown in the body. So, Ignite helps in weight loss, enhances metabolism, and increases energy levels.&nbsp;</p>
